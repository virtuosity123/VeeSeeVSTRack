Hi,

Since release v0.5.4, KlokSpid internal modules IDs are changed (due to source merge).

In case you get an error message while you're opening .vcv patch file, open the .vcv file by using any
text editor (like Notepad on Windows, or Text Edit on MacOS).

Search any occurences of following (include first quote in your search criteria), exactly like this:

"KlokSpid

Per found occurence, remove trailings such Classic, Stage, Dark or DBlue - BUT DON'T REMOVE quotation
marks surrounding "KlokSpid" word, it's very important!

Save file, close text editor, then you'll can repoen .vcv file: all KlokSpid modules will come back,
correctly configured, but as Classic (beige). So you'll can change model you'd like, via its right-click
menu (context-menu).

Selected model will be saved along .vcv patch files (don't forget to re-save it).
