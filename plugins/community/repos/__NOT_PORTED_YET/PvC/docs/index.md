... is a set of [VCVRack](https://www.vcvrack.com) modules created mainly for my own use.
Most are modified and/or slimmified versions of others or just simple tools/toys
i wanted to have and enjoyed learning to program.  
These modules are my learning playground, so anything might change at any time.


## Disclaimer

**This is NOT production level software! ... expect bugs, beginner mistakes, etc.**

[Any and all feedback is welcome.](https://github.com/phdsg/PvC/issues)


## Thanks

First of all: Andrew Belt for making VCVRack and making it open source.  
All the other module developers for their inspiring modules, especially [Strum: his modules](https://github.com/Strum/Strums_Mental_VCV_Modules) and encouragement made me start this whole programming trip.

## Build Instructions

  To build the modules from source you first have to build rack from sources as described here:  
    [setting up your dev environment](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack#setting-up-your-development-environment)  

  Then clone this repository into rack's plugins folder.  
    `$ cd plugins && git clone https://github.com/phdsg/PvC`  
    
  Change directory to PvC and use make to build the plugin.  
    `$ cd PvC && make`  
  

## Contact & Help
I'm almost always online @ #VCVRack on Freenode (irc.freenode.net #VCVRack). Other module devs are too!  
Also, the [issue tracker](https://github.com/phdsg/PvC/issues) can be used for all questions.


## Gumroad & Donations

At the end of last year i made a gumroad account to check out their platform.
Some of you (way more than i expected) actually found the link and clicked it.  

__Thank you all for your support!__

Still exploring some ideas where to go with the gumroad store in 2018...

(until then it's still [up](https://gumroad.com/pvc) there.)
