It can learn relationships between notes by building up a probability map in the form of a weighted one-directional graph.

### piong

A simulation of the [classic arcade game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong).

It can be played by turning knobs on the screen, or by sending control voltage signals to its inputs (for example from LFOs or MIDI-CC).

The gameâ€™s outputs can be used as signals to sequence, trigger and modulate other stuff in your rack.
